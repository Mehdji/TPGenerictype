# Java Generics Project

This project is part of my coursework on **object-oriented programming in Java**, focusing on the concept of **generics** (`<T>`).  
It demonstrates how generic classes, methods, and collections can be used to write flexible and reusable code.

## ðŸ§© Project Overview

The project explores several key Java concepts:
- **Generic classes** and **methods**
- **Bounded type parameters** (`<T extends ...>`)
- **Collections** with generics (`List<T>`, `Map<K, V>`, `Set<T>`)
- **Shallow and deep copies** of maps
- **Polymorphism** and **interfaces** (`Comparable`, `Comparator`, custom interfaces like `Empruntable`)

It also includes examples of:
- Creating generic methods that work with multiple data types
- Implementing interfaces and using polymorphism in class hierarchies
- Sorting collections with and without comparators

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

- Understand how **Java generics** improve **type safety** and **code reusability**
- Apply **polymorphism** and **interfaces** to design flexible systems
- Practice **collection manipulation** with generics (`HashMap`, `ArrayList`, etc.)
- Write clear, maintainable Java code following OOP principles

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **Java 17** (or later)
- **IntelliJ IDEA** as the IDE
- **Git & GitHub** for version control
